The security model in Connect IQ is designed to give the developer and the user the tools to know that their device and their information is safe with Garmin.</p><p class="p">Connect IQ has three levels of trust for apps:</p><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Trusted</strong> - Content that has been approved by the app store. These apps have passed the Garmin review process and can be downloaded from the Connect IQ store.</p></li><li class="li"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Developer</strong> - Content that has been written by an individual developer, but has not been released in the Connect IQ store. This content can be used for testing, but is not an officially released app.</p></li><li class="li"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Untrusted</strong> - Content that should not be run on device.</p></li></ul><p class="p">These levels of trust are enforced using digital signatures. Key management has been worked into the app store, the device, and the developer SDK. The goal is to make sure that apps loaded from developers only come from two locations - the app store or a trusted developer.</p></div><article aria-labelledby="ariaid-title2" class="topic nested1" id="developer-keys"><h2 class="title topictitle2" id="ariaid-title2">Developer Keys</h2><div class="body"><p class="p">The Connect IQ compiler requires a developer key be provided to for signing when compiling and packaging apps. The required key must be a RSA 4096 bit private key.</p><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Note</strong>: It's important you keep track of the key you use to sign app packages. You will need to use the same key to sign updates to an existing app on the store. If you lose your original signing key you will not be able to update your app.</p></div></article><article aria-labelledby="ariaid-title3" class="topic nested1" id="generating-a-key-using-visual-studio-code"><h2 class="title topictitle2" id="ariaid-title3">Generating a Key Using Visual Studio Code</h2><div class="body"><p class="p">If you have a developer key you can set the path to it by selecting <em class="ph i">File &gt; Preferences &gt; Settings &gt; Monkey C</em> and setting the <em class="ph i">Monkey C: Developer Key Path</em> to your developer key. If you do not have a developer key, you can create one using the <em class="ph i">Monkey C: Generate Developer Key</em> command in the command palette, or the Monkey C extension will create one when you verify the installation using the <em class="ph i">Monkey C: Verify Installation</em> command.</p></div></article><article aria-labelledby="ariaid-title4" class="topic nested1" id="generating-a-key-using-openssl"><h2 class="title topictitle2" id="ariaid-title4">Generating a Key Using OpenSSL</h2><div class="body"><p class="p">If you're working from the command line you can generate a RSA key using <a class="xref" href="https://www.openssl.org/" target="_blank">OpenSSL</a>.

The Monkey C tool will automatically sign your app based on your key. Your apps will run at the Developer privilege level. Apps signed by the app store run at the Trusted privilege level. The content of their object store will be encrypted and unreadable from the Connect IQ developer tools.</p><p class="p">The app store requires IQ files to be digitally signed. Your upload will be rejected If the developer key has changed since your last upload.</p></div></article></article></main></div>

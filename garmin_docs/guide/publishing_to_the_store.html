The GDPR provides requirements for the lawful processing of EU Personal Data, including requirements related to data privacy, consent, and digital services. GDPR generally applies to the processing of EU Personal Data, and it may apply to you or your company even if you are not in the EU. Data protection authorities may issue fines up to 4% of annual global turnover or â‚¬20 Million, whichever is greater, for non-compliance. . This isn't legal advice and we encourage you to consult with your legal counsel for guidance.</p><p class="p">Connect IQ is a global platform, and, as stated in the <a class="xref" href="https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/sdk" target="_blank">Connect IQ license agreement</a>, developers are responsible for their apps' compliance with all applicable laws, including those related to data protection and privacy. Specific responsibilities related to privacy can be found in Section 2 of the <a class="xref" href="https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/sdk" target="_blank">Connect IQ license agreement</a>. Developers should review the GDPR to determine what obligations they may have under the GDPR. These obligations may include the following:</p><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">Asking for consent for collection of personal data.</p></li><li class="li"><p class="p">Providing access to information on what personal data concerning them is being processed, where and for what purpose.</p></li><li class="li"><p class="p">Providing access to any personal data collected from them free of charge.</p></li><li class="li"><p class="p">Ability for a user to erase their presence entirely within your product, including the ability to halt third party processing of personal data.</p></li></ul><p class="p">If your solution collects personal data in any way, including using the <code class="ph codeph">Communications</code> permission to collect or retain personal data (potentially in conjunction with <code class="ph codeph">Sensor</code>, <code class="ph codeph">Sensor History</code>, or <code class="ph codeph">Position</code> permissions) or using any other mechanism, you are responsible for ensuring that your solution is in compliance with GDPR.</p></div></article><article aria-labelledby="ariaid-title6" class="topic nested1" id="approval-process"><h2 class="title topictitle2" id="ariaid-title6">Approval Process</h2><div class="body"><p class="p">After your app is successfully uploaded to the app store, the Connect IQ team will review your submission. Aside from special circumstances, such as national holidays, reviews are completed within 72 hours.</p><p class="p">If you indicate your app uses one or more ANT+ profiles, an additional 48 hours is typically required to complete ANT+ certification. Once certification is complete, we'll provide ANT+ branding information and a link to the <a class="xref" href="https://www.thisisant.com/directory" target="_blank">ANT+ Directory</a> to add to your app's description on the store.</p><p class="p">While approval is pending, your app will not appear on the Garmin Connect App Store, but you will be able to preview your app and download it yourself for testing. Once it's approved, you will receive a notification and it will appear on the Connect IQ App Store for all users to download and load to their devices!</p><p class="p">If for some reason your app is rejected, don't despair! The Connect IQ team will provide specific reasons for the rejection via email, and may work with you to resolve issues. The app will continue to be available for you to update as needed and re-submit for approval, but it will not be displayed on the Connect IQ App Store until approved.</p></div></article></article></main></div>
